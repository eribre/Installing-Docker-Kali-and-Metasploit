# Kali Linux and Metasploitable2 on Apple Silicon

For Himolde IBE321 students.

A short tutorial on how to setup docker as an alternative to Virtualbox for running Kali Linux and Metasploitable on your Apple Silicon Mac for the IBE321 labs.

If you are using an Intel Mac or a non-ARM Windows machine then you can simply follow the VirtualBox tutorial by Anolan instead.
